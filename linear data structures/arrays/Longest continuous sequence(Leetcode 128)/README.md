Longest Consecutive Numbers in an Array

You are given an array 

n

u

m

s

nums containing integers.



Your task is to find the size of the largest subset of consecutive integers. The order of elements in the original array does not matter — they can be rearranged to form the consecutive sequence. The test cases may contain duplicate values.



Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer 

T

T, denoting the number of test cases.



Each test case consists of multiple lines of input:



The first line of each test case contains a single integer 

N

N — the number of elements in the array.

The next line contains 

N

N space-separated integers 

n

u

m

s

\[

i

]

nums\[i] — the elements of the array.

Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line a single integer — the size of the largest subset of consecutive integers that can be formed from the array.
